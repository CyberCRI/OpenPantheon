    "main_title": "We are happy to welcome you to the Open Pantheon.",
    "first_step": "Nominate.",
    "first_step_paragraph": "First and foremost, we invite you to pay tribute to inspirational figures, whether in your community, country or globally, who have played a key role in the field of learning. This may be across all related disciplines, notably art, science, sustainability, pedagogy, health and wellbeing, thus contributing to a peaceful coexistence of humans and nature (in line with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations).",
    "second_step": "Discover.",
    "second_step_paragraph": "Thanks to our collective contribution, the Open Pantheon platform will give you the opportunity to be inspired by an ever growing and unique range of exemplary figures, navigating across centuries, cultures and disciplines.",
    "first_section_title": "How does it work?",
    "first_section_first_paragraph": "Individuals and organisations are invited to nominate personalities of their choice in their personal Pantheon, under the condition that these personalities already have a bio on Wikipedia* and that they are related to fields such as education, the sciences, culture, and the promotion of peace.",
    "first_section_second_paragraph": "When adding a personality to their Pantheon, organisations and individuals act as their sponsor by writing a succinct argument explaining their choice (compulsory). They may also choose to add meaningful links (article, book, etc.).",
    "first_section_third_paragraph": "All nominated personalities then appear in the Open Pantheon platform, with a link to their Wikipedia bio and the succinct argument of each organisation/individual paying a personal tribute to their legacy.",
    "first_section_fourth_paragraph": "The collective crowdsourcing and distributed open tribute processes will allow for the celebration of local figures as well as of internationally renowned celebrities.",
    "first_section_fifth_paragraph": "The Open Pantheon search engine will thus offer a unique opportunity to (re-)discover and be inspired by diverse groups of people across centuries and cultures, across communities and genders.",
    "first_section_sixth_paragraph": "A moderation system will be put in place on the platform to avoid abuse and deal with personalities/comments that may be considered inappropriate by the community.",
    "first_section_addendum": "*When an inspirational figure cannot be found on Wikipedia, organisations/ individuals are encouraged to create a new Wikipedia bio prior to starting the Open Pantheon nomination process.",
    "second_section_title": "Languages",
    "second_section_first_paragraph": "The initial version of this new global online platform is currently available in English and French. In the near future, new languages will be added, notably the 4 other UN official languages (Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish).",
    "second_section_addendum": "Would you like to support us in rapidly adding more languages? Please contact us at info@open-pantheon.org.",
    "third_section_title": "About #LearningPlanet",
    "third_section_first_paragraph": "In 2019, CRI and UNESCO joined forces to give birth to the #LearningPlanet initiative, which has since federated a rapidly growing international community of organisations (institutions, universities, social entrepreneurs, associations, artists, media, etc.) committed to all key areas related to sustainable futures, especially that of young people: education, health, well-being, rights, sustainable development... Determined to increase and accelerate their impact on the ground, these organisations are exploring and striving to implement radical collaborative models. #LearningPlanet thus co-designs and co-constructs programmes (thematic circles, events, training courses, field projects, etc.) and open digital tools (Projects platform, knowledge GPS, Open Pantheon) to enable community members to achieve ambitious goals together."

  "faq": {
    "main_title": "FAQ",
    "register_question": "Do I have to register on the Open Pantheon platform to nominate a personality?",
    "register_answer": "You may browse the Open Pantheon platform without registering, but you do need to create an account to nominate a personality of your choice and/or to make comments. Indeed, the whole point of the Open Pantheon isn’t only to crowdsource personalities but also to share diverse and complementary views on what makes each of them truly inspiring through succinct arguments.",
    "delete_question": "Can I delete my account?",
    "delete_answer": "In compliance with European regulations, you can ask to delete your account by contacting us on info@open-pantheon.org. Please use the email address you registered with.",
    "wikipedia_question": "Why is it compulsory to choose a personality with a Wikipedia bio?",
    "wikipedia_answer": "While allowing everyone to contribute to the Open Pantheon, we would like to make sure, especially during the launch phase, that the platform offers a range of figures that may be a source of inspiration for all viewers. For instance, while a wise grandfather or grandmother can definitely be a role model, it is key that the nominated personalities are chosen beyond the immediate family-community circle. Naturally, if a relative or a community member deserves to be more widely honoured, the possibility of creating a Wikipedia bio offers a straightforward way for them entering the Open Pantheon.",
    "anyone_question": "Can I nominate any personality with a Wikipedia bio in My Pantheon?",
    "anyone_answer": "Dictators, war heroes, famous outlaws and assassins, and other disreputable personalities may have a bio on Wikipedia, but shouldn’t be nominated on the Open Pantheon platform. The Open Pantheon aims at crowdsourcing exemplary figures in the field of learning, across all related disciplines, especially art, science, pedagogy, health and wellbeing, environment and peace. These categories already offer a broad choice to the organisations and individuals willing to contribute to the platform; they should be the core focus of all contributors. Naturally, prominent business leaders, politicians and other decision-makers also have their bio on Wikipedia, and may be considered in respect to specific achievements.",
    "irreproachable_question": "It is rare for a personality to be irreproachable in all respects. What criteria should guide my personal Pantheon choices?",
    "irreproachable_answer": "It is indeed rare for a personality to be irreproachable or to be unanimous, especially in a multicultural context. The challenge of the Open Pantheon is nevertheless to emphasise what, in each of the personalities honoured, deserves this recognition. This is the purpose of the comments section accompanying each nomination, which will highlight these qualities by offering a variety of angles of appreciation.",
    "minor_question": "I’m under 18, can I still participate in the Open Pantheon?",
    "minor_answer": "Yes you can add personalities to your Personal Pantheon. However, please note that the following data will be stored on our servers: your email (only visible by you, protected and never shared with anyone), your pseudo (visible by all visitors, chosen by yourself), your password (stored hashed, not visible by anyone, not even by the administrators and developers), your contributions (the figures you added to your Pantheon) and your comments, visible by everyone on the Web. You can delete them at any time. We also encourage you to create a collective Pantheon with your classmates. Don’t hesitate to propose this as a group activity to your teacher.",
    "how_many_personalities_question": "How many personalities can I nominate in My Pantheon?",
    "how_many_personalities_answer": "You are not limited in the number of personalities that you may nominate.",
    "how_many_links_question": "How many links may I add to a given personality in My Pantheon?",
    "how_many_links_answer": "You may add up to 10 meaningful links to each personality that you nominate. You can add links to any useful online resources, such as articles, books, videos, history websites, etc.",
    "delete_personality_question": "Can I suppress a personality that I have nominated?",
    "delete_personality_answer": "You can suppress a personality in your personal space “My Pantheon” at any given time. Open the page of the person you are celebrating, then click on the three dots in the corner of your comment and select “Delete”. If you were the only contributor to have initially chosen this personality, it will disappear from the platform. If other contributors have nominated this personality, only your tribute will disappear from the related comments.",
    "edit_question": "Can I modify the succinct argument that I have written in support of a given nomination?",
    "edit_answer": "You may modify any succinct argument that you have written simply by connecting to your personal space \"My Pantheon\".",
    "private_question": "May I create My Pantheon and decide not to share it with the online community?",
    "private_answer": "No, by registering on the Open Pantheon platform and nominating personalities in your personal Pantheon, you also explicitly agree to have your suggestions and comments shared with the Open Pantheon community and more widely with the general public visiting the online platform.",
    "gender_question": "How do you expect to attain gender diversity?",
    "gender_answer": "It is up to the community, both individuals and organisations, to aim for gender diversity when nominating the personalities of their choice. The Open Pantheon platform displays the gender split via a dedicated counter on the homepage, which may serve as an incentive if necessary. Wikipedia has recently added gender diversity support (i.e. transgender, non-binary, neutral...). However, the data is still rarely used. To date, we display only a male/female balance and will expand this in a future version.",
    "languages_question": "Even if the Open Pantheon platform were soon to be accessible in all 6 official UN languages, this wouldn't allow all cultures to be represented on an equal footing. Isn’t this contradictory with the Open Pantheon’s goal? How do you plan to address this challenge?",
    "languages_answer": "The Open Pantheon website was launched in September 2021 in English and French. Our immediate goal is to align with the UN and offer the platform in all 6 official languages as soon as possible (in 2022). In the near future, and if the Open Pantheon community grows in different parts of the world, our ambition is to create partnerships with organisations across other countries to help us provide translation in other languages too.",
    "no_translation_question": "What will happen if a Wikipedia bio is available in one language of the platform and not in others?",
    "no_translation_answer": "Any personality with a bio on Wikipedia, in at least one language, is eligible to be featured on the Open Pantheon website. If the bio is only available in one language, it will appear in this language until being translated on Wikipedia.",
    "moderation_question": "How does the moderation system work? Who is ultimately responsible for determining the personalities who may or may not be celebrated on the global open platform?",
    "moderation_answer": "The Open Pantheon is aligned with UNESCO’s mission of promoting world peace and security through international cooperation in education, the sciences, and culture. It is also supported by the #LearningPlanet community, a truly global network of leading educational organisations (institutions, universities, research centres, social entrepreneurs, etc.) across the world, already present in 120+ countries. The moderation process] will study carefully all reported cases of abuse and will act in accordance with the key principles guiding the international community. In case of very difficult decisions to be made, the moderator will call upon the expertise of key organisations within the #LearningPlanet community to seek advice. In the future, if the Open Pantheon is to grow massively, a more structured process may be structured, encompassing notably the creation of an official ethics committee.",
    "abuse_question": "How can I report abuse?",
    "abuse_answer": "You can report abuse simply by using the Contact form and selecting “Report abuse”. The contact form is accessible on all pages of the website in the top navigation bar."
